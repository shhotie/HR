                <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Tell me about yourself and your current role.</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Swati Wanjari</strong>. I have over <strong>4 years of experience in Java
                            development</strong>,
                        mainly focused on building scalable web applications and microservices using <strong>Java 8,
                            Spring Boot, and
                            REST APIs</strong>. I’ve worked across domains like regulatory compliance, credit
                        processing, and medical
                        staffing platforms.</p>

                    <p>Recently, I worked on the <strong>SmartReg project at Smarbl Limited</strong> — it’s a
                        cloud-based regulatory
                        compliance platform where I developed RESTful APIs, implemented custom workflows, and
                        contributed to secure
                        deployments using <strong>Docker and Jenkins</strong>. I also collaborated on Angular components
                        for front-end
                        integration.</p>

                    <p>I follow <strong>Agile practices</strong> and contribute to end-to-end development — from
                        designing APIs to
                        deploying production-ready features. I’m now looking for opportunities where I can further grow
                        as a
                        <strong>full-stack or backend developer</strong> while contributing to impactful products.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Can you describe a challenging situation in your
                    project and how you resolved it?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Yes, one challenging situation I faced was during the development of the report cloning feature
                        in the SmartReg
                        project. The requirement was to allow users to duplicate an existing regulatory report—along
                        with all its
                        sections, rules, and metadata—so they could reuse it for the next period.</p>

                    <p>The challenge came when cloning reports that had complex nested relationships, like validation
                        rules linked to
                        specific sections, and user permissions tied to those sections. Initially, our clone logic was
                        copying only the
                        top-level report structure but missed these linked entities. This led to broken references and
                        missing data in
                        the cloned reports, which affected user experience.</p>

                    <p><strong>To resolve this:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I analyzed the entity relationships deeply and updated the clone logic to recursively copy
                            all dependent
                            entities, preserving relationships like foreign keys and ownership metadata.</li>
                        <li>I added transactional handling using <code>@Transactional</code> to ensure either the full
                            report was cloned
                            successfully or rolled back in case of an error.</li>
                        <li>We also implemented proper exception handling and user messages when a clone failed due to
                            business rules
                            like duplicate periods.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>After the fix, the cloning feature worked smoothly, reduced manual effort for users, and also
                        improved trust in
                        the system.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Have you ever disagreed with your team lead or
                    manager? How did you handle it?</div>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>Yes, I have experienced situations where I had a different viewpoint than my team lead. When that happens, I make
                            sure to approach it professionally. First, I try to fully understand their perspective, and then I share my own
                            thoughts with clear reasoning and possible alternatives.</p>
                    
                        <p>I believe it's important to focus on the goal of delivering the best solution, not on who is right. If needed, I
                            support my suggestion with examples, data, or even a quick prototype to make the decision easier.</p>
                    
                        <p>In most cases, this open and respectful communication has helped us reach a consensus or even come up with a
                            better combined approach. I’ve found that healthy technical discussions often lead to stronger outcomes and
                            better collaboration within the team.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Describe a time you had to deliver under tight
                    deadlines.</div>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>Yes, I’ve faced situations where I had to deliver under tight deadlines, especially during sprint closures or
                            last-minute change requests from stakeholders.</p>
                    
                        <p>One such instance was when we had a high-priority feature that needed to be delivered quickly due to a regulatory
                            update. The timeline was shorter than usual, and the change involved backend logic and frontend adjustments. I
                            quickly aligned with the BA to clarify requirements, broke the task into smaller, manageable parts, and
                            prioritized the critical pieces first.</p>
                    
                        <p>I worked with focus, collaborated closely with QA for early feedback, and wrote unit tests alongside development
                            to save time later. By coordinating efficiently with the team and staying focused, we were able to deliver the
                            feature within the deadline — without compromising code quality.</p>
                    
                        <p>That experience reinforced the importance of clear communication, time management, and staying calm under
                            pressure.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Have you mentored junior developers or taken any
                    leadership responsibilities?</div>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>Yes, I’ve taken on informal leadership responsibilities in my current role. While I’m not in a formal lead
                            position, I’ve often guided junior developers, especially when onboarding new team members or during sprint
                            planning.</p>
                    
                        <p>For example, I’ve helped junior teammates understand our codebase structure, shared best practices in REST API
                            development, and reviewed their code to ensure adherence to coding standards. I also encourage them to write
                            clean, testable code and explain the reasoning behind design decisions like where to place business logic or how
                            to structure services.</p>
                    
                        <p>These experiences have strengthened my communication and collaboration skills, and I enjoy helping others grow
                            while also learning through team discussions.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">How do you prioritize tasks when you have multiple
                    deliverables?</div>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>When I have multiple deliverables, I prioritize tasks based on urgency, business impact, and dependencies. I
                            usually start by reviewing the deadlines and identifying which items are time-sensitive or blocking others. Then
                            I break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable steps and estimate the effort involved.</p>
                    
                        <p>If there’s any ambiguity, I clarify priorities with the product owner or team lead to make sure I'm aligned with
                            the overall goals. I also use tools like JIRA to track progress and make adjustments as needed.</p>
                    
                        <p>For example, if I’m working on a feature and a production bug is reported, I’ll assess the severity of the bug.
                            If it impacts users or system stability, I’ll pause the current task, resolve the issue, and then switch back —
                            ensuring smooth delivery without compromising quality.</p>
                    
                        <p>Staying organized and maintaining open communication with the team helps me manage workload effectively.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Tell me about a situation where your code caused an
                    issue in production. How did you handle it?</div>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>Yes, I believe mistakes are part of learning, and I’ve faced such a situation.</p>
                    
                        <p>Once, I had deployed an API enhancement where I added a new field in the response, but I didn’t realize that an
                            external system was consuming that API and was not expecting the modified structure. After deployment, that
                            system started throwing errors, and the issue was quickly flagged by QA during post-deployment verification.</p>
                    
                        <p>As soon as I was notified, I checked the logs, identified the change, and rolled back the deployment to restore
                            stability. I then coordinated with the external team to understand their contract expectations and made the
                            change backward-compatible.</p>
                    
                        <p>After that incident, I took extra steps to ensure:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We clearly documented API contracts.</li>
                            <li>Added automated regression tests for existing consumers.</li>
                            <li>Introduced a versioning strategy for APIs.</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                        <p>It was a great learning experience in terms of how even small changes can affect downstream systems and the
                            importance of communication and testing before release.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">How do you handle feedback or criticism about your
                    work?</div>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>I welcome feedback and see it as an opportunity to improve. Whether it’s positive or constructive, I try to
                            listen with an open mind and avoid taking it personally. If someone points out an issue in my code or approach,
                            I first try to understand the reasoning behind it, ask clarifying questions if needed, and reflect on how I can
                            do better next time.</p>
                    
                        <p>For example, during a code review in one of my earlier sprints, a senior developer suggested refactoring my
                            service class to follow the Single Responsibility Principle. I took the time to understand the design principle,
                            made the suggested changes, and applied that learning in future implementations.</p>
                    
                        <p>Constructive feedback has helped me write cleaner, more maintainable code, and has improved my collaboration
                            within the team. I believe it’s a key part of professional growth.</p>

                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>I strongly believe in effective cross-functional collaboration to ensure smooth project delivery. In my current
                            role, I regularly work with QA, frontend, and DevOps teams throughout the development lifecycle:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>I provide early walkthroughs of the feature and share API contracts using Swagger or Postman collections.
                            </li>
                            <li>I assist in setting up test data and clarifying expected responses or business logic.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>We align on API contracts — I make sure endpoints, request/response formats, and error handling are
                                well-documented and consistent.</li>
                            <li>I support integration testing and help debug issues that may arise during UI-to-API interaction.</li>
                            <li>In the SmartReg project, I’ve even contributed to Angular components when needed, making collaboration

                        <ul>
                            <li>I prepare deployment-ready code, including Docker configurations and environment properties.</li>
                            <li>I work with them to set up CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and monitor logs post-deployment.</li>
                            <li>During incidents, we coordinate together to quickly rollback or patch deployments.</li>

                    distributed or remote team?</div>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <h3>Communication Practices in a Distributed Team</h3>
                    
                        <h4>1. Daily Stand-ups:</h4>
                        <p>I actively participate in daily stand-up calls to share progress, blockers, and upcoming tasks. It keeps everyone
                            updated and aligned, fostering collaboration despite being remote.</p>
                    
                        <h4>2. Clear and Structured Communication:</h4>
                        <p>Whether it's emails, Slack messages, or updates in project tracking tools like JIRA, I make sure my messages are
                            concise, well-structured, and to the point. This helps avoid confusion, especially when working across time
                            zones.</p>
                    
                        <h4>3. Documentation:</h4>
                        <p>Documentation is a key aspect of distributed work. I document API contracts, feature flows, and configuration
                            steps using Confluence or shared docs. This reduces the need for repeated clarifications and enables async
                            collaboration.</p>
                    
                        <h4>4. Regular Check-ins:</h4>
                        <p>For active modules or urgent features, I set up quick sync calls with QA, frontend, or DevOps teams. This ensures
                            smooth coordination and timely problem resolution.</p>
                    
                        <h4>5. Responsiveness and Availability:</h4>
                        <p>I stay responsive during work hours and keep my calendar updated to manage expectations about my availability. If
                            I'm unavailable, I leave status updates so team members know my progress and can plan accordingly.</p>
                    
                        <h4>6. Using Collaboration Tools Effectively:</h4>
                        <p>Tools like JIRA, Slack, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, and Confluence play an essential role in managing
                            communication, tasks, and documentation effectively across the team.</p>

                <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Have you ever handled a conflict within your team?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Yes, I have handled team-level conflicts in a constructive way.</p>
                
                    <p>In one instance, during a sprint in the SmartReg project, a misunderstanding arose between a frontend developer
                        and a backend teammate over delays in API readiness. The frontend developer assumed the delay was due to backend
                        negligence, while the backend teammate was waiting for finalized business rules from the BA.</p>
                
                    <p>Rather than letting tension grow, I initiated a calm discussion involving both parties. I clarified the actual
                        blocker — which was incomplete requirements — and suggested a temporary mock API response for the frontend to
                        continue development. Meanwhile, I coordinated with the business analyst to quickly finalize the rules so we
                        could deliver the real API on time.</p>
                
                    <p>This avoided finger-pointing and helped the team focus on a solution instead of blame. I’ve found that clear
                        communication, empathy, and staying objective are key to resolving conflicts efficiently.</p>

                    start to end?</div>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>In my current project, <strong>SmartReg</strong> — a regulatory compliance platform — I’ve been involved
                            end-to-end, starting from requirement understanding to deployment.</p>
                    
                        <p>In the initial phase, I participated in sprint planning, understood requirements from the product owner, and
                            worked with the team to break them down into technical tasks.</p>
                    
                        <p>I was responsible for designing and developing REST APIs using Java 8 and Spring Boot. I focused on writing
                            reusable and scalable code following best practices.</p>
                    
                        <p>I implemented custom workflows, like multi-step approval processes, and contributed to report generation modules,
                            including features to clone, modify, and submit reports to regulatory bodies like RBI.</p>
                    
                        <p>On the database side, I worked with PostgreSQL to design and optimize queries and handled schema changes where
                            needed.</p>
                    
                        <p>I also supported Angular development for a few modules — especially where backend and frontend needed tight
                            coordination.</p>
                    
                        <p>For CI/CD, I used Jenkins for automated build and deployments, and Docker to containerize services.</p>
                    
                        <p>I was involved in unit testing, handled bug fixes, and supported QA during UAT.</p>
                    
                        <p>Once deployed, I monitored APIs using logs and tools like Spring Boot Actuator and made quick fixes when needed.
                        </p>
                    
                        <p>Throughout the project, I followed Agile methodology, participated in daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and
                            retrospectives.</p>
                    
                        <p>Overall, I’ve contributed to all stages of the project — from development and testing to deployment and support —
                            and worked closely with cross-functional teams.</p>

                <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Have you taken ownership of any feature/module
                    independently?</div>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>Yes, I’ve taken complete ownership of several features in my current project, <strong>SmartReg</strong>. One key
                            example was the <strong>Report Clone module</strong>.</p>
                    
                        <p>In this feature, I was responsible for:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Understanding the business requirement of allowing users to duplicate existing regulatory reports to create
                                a new version with slight modifications.</li>
                            <li>Designing and developing the backend logic using Java 8 and Spring Boot, ensuring that all dependent data —
                                like rules, validations, and approval statuses — were properly cloned without breaking the original report's
                                integrity.</li>
                            <li>Creating REST APIs to fetch, modify, and save cloned report data.</li>
                            <li>Implementing exception handling for scenarios like missing references, null data, or invalid report states.
                            </li>
                            <li>Coordinating with the frontend team to integrate this feature using Angular and ensuring smooth UI/API flow.
                            </li>
                            <li>Writing unit tests and participating in peer reviews to ensure quality.</li>
                            <li>Handling deployment of this feature through Jenkins and monitoring its performance post-release.</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                        <p>Taking ownership of this feature helped me strengthen my skills in requirement analysis, technical design,
                            coding, testing, and production support, all while collaborating closely with QA and product teams.</p>

                    your team?</div>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>Ensuring code quality and maintainability is a continuous process, and I follow several practices both
                            individually and within the team:</p>
                    
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Clean Code Principles:</strong> I follow best practices like meaningful naming, modular methods,
                                proper exception handling, and avoiding code duplication.</li>
                    
                            <li><strong>Code Reviews:</strong> We conduct peer reviews for every merge request. I not only review others’
                                code but also welcome suggestions on mine. Reviews help catch potential bugs early and encourage knowledge
                                sharing.</li>
                    
                            <li><strong>Adherence to Standards:</strong> We follow common coding standards and architecture patterns, like
                                layered architecture and SOLID principles, to keep the codebase consistent and maintainable.</li>
                    
                            <li><strong>Unit Testing:</strong> I write unit tests for my services using JUnit and Mockito, which ensures the
                                code works as expected and gives confidence during refactoring.</li>
                    
                            <li><strong>Static Code Analysis:</strong> Tools like SonarQube or Lint help identify code smells, potential
                                bugs, and maintainability issues early in the CI pipeline.</li>
                    
                            <li><strong>Refactoring:</strong> I proactively refactor legacy or bulky code when needed — for example,
                                breaking large methods into smaller, reusable ones, or simplifying nested logic.</li>
                    
                            <li><strong>Documentation and Comments:</strong> I document complex logic where necessary, and maintain API
                                documentation using tools like Swagger, so the code is easy to understand for others.</li>
                    
                            <li><strong>Agile Practices:</strong> Regular sprint reviews and retrospectives help us assess not just delivery
                                but also our technical practices and improve continuously.</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                        <p>These steps collectively help maintain a high-quality, scalable, and easy-to-maintain codebase.</p>

                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>Yes, I have been involved in client communication and requirement gathering, especially during the initial phases
                            of new modules or features.</p>
                    
                        <p>In the SmartReg project, for example, I regularly joined meetings with business analysts and sometimes directly
                            with client-side stakeholders to understand the regulatory requirements for compliance report generation. These
                            sessions helped clarify:</p>
                    
                        <ul>
                            <li>What rules needed to be applied for different types of financial institutions,</li>
                            <li>The structure and format expected in reports,</li>
                            <li>And edge cases like report versioning or conditional validations.</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                        <p>I actively took notes, asked questions to resolve technical ambiguities, and collaborated with my team to break
                            down the requirements into development tasks.</p>
                    
                        <p>This direct involvement helped reduce rework, improved the accuracy of delivered features, and made it easier to
                            design APIs that aligned with user expectations.</p>
                    
                        <p>While I may not lead the discussions, I’m confident in client-facing roles and understand the importance of clear
                            communication in delivering the right solution.</p>

                            prioritize based on impact and deadlines.</p>
                    
                        <p>In my current role, I often receive inputs from product owners, QA, and sometimes even DevOps — especially close
                            to release cycles. To manage this pressure:</p>
                    
                        <ul>
                            <li>I prioritize based on business impact and urgency, often using tools like JIRA to track and categorize
                                tasks.</li>
                            <li>I communicate early — if I see a conflict in timelines or feasibility, I proactively inform the stakeholders
                                and suggest alternatives or phased delivery.</li>
                            <li>I break down large tasks into smaller deliverables, which helps show consistent progress and reduces
                                last-minute stress.</li>
                            <li>I stay calm under pressure and focus on solving problems rather than getting overwhelmed.</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                        <p>For example, in the SmartReg project, just before a compliance deadline, we had last-minute changes from the
                            client along with a critical bug reported by QA. I discussed timelines with my team lead, isolated the issues,
                            and worked with DevOps for a quick hotfix while scheduling the enhancements in the next sprint.</p>
                    
                        <p>By managing expectations clearly and working collaboratively, I was able to deliver without compromising quality.

                <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Have you contributed to sprint planning, estimations,
                    or retrospectives?</div>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>Yes, I’ve been actively involved in sprint ceremonies including planning, estimations, and retrospectives as part
                            of Agile development.</p>
                    
                        <p>In sprint planning, I contribute by breaking down tasks into technical subtasks and providing realistic time
                            estimates based on complexity, dependencies, and team capacity. I often refer to past sprints and similar
                            modules to give better estimates, especially for backend API or integration work.</p>
                    
                        <p>For example, during the SmartReg project, I estimated effort for new report generation modules and identified
                            reusable components, which helped us plan better and avoid duplication of effort.</p>
                    
                        <p>In retrospectives, I openly share what went well and what could be improved. For instance, I once suggested
                            implementing early code reviews in the sprint to avoid last-minute merge issues — and that feedback was later
                            adopted by the team.</p>
                    
                        <p>Being part of these ceremonies helps ensure better planning, smoother execution, and continuous improvement in
                            the development process.</p>

                <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">If you're assigned a new technology you're unfamiliar
                    with, how would you approach learning it?</div>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>If I’m assigned a new technology that I’m not familiar with, I approach it with a structured and hands-on
                            mindset.</p>
                    
                        <p><strong>Understand the context</strong> – I start by understanding why the technology is being used, how it fits
                            into the project architecture, and what problem it's solving. This gives me direction and purpose while
                            learning.</p>
                    
                        <p><strong>Official documentation & tutorials</strong> – I first refer to official docs and reliable tutorials to
                            get a strong foundation on core concepts, setup, and best practices.</p>
                    
                        <p><strong>Hands-on practice</strong> – I prefer building a small POC (proof of concept) to explore the key
                            features. This helps me learn faster and discover real-time challenges.</p>
                    
                        <p><strong>Ask team members</strong> – If needed, I reach out to experienced teammates or explore internal project
                            references to understand implementation standards.</p>
                    
                        <p><strong>Time management</strong> – I allocate focused learning time outside of work hours when required,
                            especially during initial ramp-up.</p>
                    
                        <p>For example, when I had to contribute to Angular components in the SmartReg project, I had limited experience
                            initially. So I followed this approach — explored the component structure, understood data binding, and
                            practiced form handling with a small demo. Within a few days, I was able to take ownership of UI features and
                            integrate them with backend APIs.</p>

                <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">How do you balance speed and quality in software
                    delivery?</div>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>Balancing speed and quality is crucial in delivering software that meets both deadlines and customer
                            expectations. To achieve this, I follow a few key strategies:</p>
                    
                        <p><strong>Define clear requirements early</strong> – Before starting, I ensure that requirements are well
                            understood, clear, and aligned with stakeholders. This avoids rework or unnecessary changes later on.</p>
                    
                        <p><strong>Adopt Agile practices</strong> – By working in sprints, we can deliver small, manageable increments of
                            the product, which helps focus on high-priority features and fixes. This also allows us to adjust the scope or
                            approach based on early feedback.</p>
                    
                        <p><strong>Implement automated testing</strong> – Automation tools for unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end
                            tests help us maintain a high standard of quality while speeding up the development process. I ensure that
                            testing is a priority at each stage of development.</p>
                    
                        <p><strong>Code reviews and pair programming</strong> – Regular code reviews help catch bugs or architectural issues
                            early, ensuring that we maintain quality without slowing down the process. Sometimes, I use pair programming for
                            critical sections, which leads to faster problem-solving.</p>
                    
                        <p><strong>Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD)</strong> – Using tools like Jenkins for CI/CD ensures that
                            our code is always tested and deployed to a staging environment quickly. This minimizes issues in production and
                            speeds up delivery.</p>
                    
                        <p><strong>Focus on incremental improvements</strong> – Instead of delivering the entire solution in one go, I break
                            down tasks into smaller, prioritized features. This allows us to release value quickly while maintaining a high
                            standard of quality.</p>
                    
                        <p>For example, in the SmartReg project, we had a tight deadline for compliance reports. We used Agile sprints to
                            break down tasks and focused on core features first, with continuous testing and reviews. By automating
                            regression tests and deploying to staging frequently, we maintained quality without delaying delivery.</p>
                    
                        <p>Ultimately, I balance speed and quality by managing the scope, focusing on key features, and using best practices
                            for testing and deployment. This ensures that we meet deadlines while delivering stable and reliable software.

                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>I’m most confident working with the Java-based backend tech stack, especially with Java 8, Spring Boot, RESTful
                        APIs, Hibernate, and PostgreSQL or MySQL as the database.</p>
                
                    <p>I’ve been using this stack consistently across all my major projects for over 4 years — including
                        <strong>SmartReg</strong>, <strong>ICICI CPS</strong>, and <strong>Nexus</strong>. I’ve built and maintained
                        REST APIs, implemented business logic using Spring Boot services, secured endpoints using Spring Security, and
                        handled database operations using Hibernate and JPA.</p>
                
                    <p>I’m also confident in CI/CD integration using Jenkins, and containerization with Docker, which ensures smooth
                        deployment cycles. On the frontend side, I’ve worked with Angular as well, and I can contribute when full-stack
                        support is needed.</p>
                
                    <p>This stack allows me to build scalable, maintainable, and secure applications effectively, and because I’ve
                        worked on real-world use cases like regulatory reporting and credit processing, I’ve gained hands-on experience
                        in debugging, performance optimization, and end-to-end delivery — which makes me very comfortable with it.</p>

                        <p><strong>Architecture Style:</strong><br>
                            We used a <strong>microservices-based architecture</strong> built using Spring Boot. Each module (such as report
                            generation, approval workflow, rule validation, etc.) was handled by a separate microservice.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Developed using Java 8, Spring Boot, and Spring MVC.</li>
                            <li>Each microservice exposed RESTful APIs for communication.</li>
                            <li>Used Spring Security with JWT tokens to secure the endpoints.</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                        <h4>Frontend:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Built using Angular (version 12).</li>
                            <li>Consumed REST APIs exposed by the backend.</li>
                            <li>Handled dynamic form rendering based on report type and user permissions.</li>

                        <h4>Database:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>PostgreSQL used for data storage.</li>
                            <li>Each service managed its own schema following Domain-Driven Design (DDD).</li>
                            <li>Audit logs and workflow data stored in dedicated tables.</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                        <h4>Workflow Engine:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Implemented a custom 3-step approval workflow (Maker → Checker → Reviewer).</li>
                            <li>Configurable and role-based.</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                        <h4>DevOps and Deployment:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Docker used to containerize services, with Docker Compose in non-prod environments.</li>
                            <li>Jenkins handled CI/CD: builds, tests, and deployments.</li>

                        </ul>
                    
                        <h4>Authentication/Authorization:</h4>

                        <p><strong>Why This Architecture?</strong><br>
                            This architecture was chosen for its scalability, modularity, and clear separation of concerns. Since SmartReg
                            serves multiple financial clients with configurable rules and validations, microservices offered the flexibility
                            and isolation required for continuous delivery.</p>

                <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">What challenges did you face while working with
                    microservices?</div>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>While working with microservices in the <strong>SmartReg</strong> project, I encountered several challenges,
                            including:</p>
                    
                        <h4>1. Service Communication & Dependency Management:</h4>
                        <p>One of the main challenges was handling inter-service communication efficiently. For example, when the reporting
                            service needed data from the validation and workflow services, we had to ensure APIs were always available and
                            responsive. To address this:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We designed clear contracts and fallback logic.</li>
                            <li>Implemented timeout settings and proper exception handling to avoid cascading failures.</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                        <h4>2. Data Consistency:</h4>
                        <p>Each service had its own database schema (as per Domain-Driven Design). This led to eventual consistency
                            challenges, especially in workflows where multiple services had to act in sequence (e.g., validation → approval
                            → report submission). To solve this:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We used transaction logs and ensured updates were processed in the correct order.</li>
                            <li>In critical cases, we built compensating transactions.</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                        <h4>3. Debugging and Tracing Across Services:</h4>
                        <p>When an issue occurred, it wasn’t always clear which service failed. So we:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Enabled centralized logging using log aggregators.</li>
                            <li>Used unique request IDs passed between services for better tracing.</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                        <h4>4. Deployment and Configuration:</h4>
                        <p>Managing multiple services meant keeping their configurations consistent across environments. To manage this:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We used Docker and Docker Compose for local development.</li>
                            <li>Ensured centralized config management using environment variables and profiles.</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                        <h4>5. Version Compatibility:</h4>
                        <p>As multiple services were developed and deployed independently, there were instances where one service’s API
                            change broke another. We mitigated this by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Following strict API versioning.</li>
                            <li>Using Swagger for documentation and automated contract validation during CI builds.</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                        <p>In short, microservices gave us flexibility and scalability, but required strong discipline in design, logging,
                            and deployment practices — all of which I actively contributed to during the SmartReg project.</p>

<div class="answer">
    <h3>Security Practices in the SmartReg Project</h3>

    <h4>1. Authentication and Authorization:</h4>
    <p>We used <strong>Spring Security</strong> along with <strong>JWT</strong> (JSON Web Tokens).</p>
    <p>After a successful login, a JWT token is issued to the user, and this token must be included in the headers for
        all secured API requests. Role-based access control (RBAC) was applied to ensure that users could only access
        resources allowed by their roles (e.g., Maker, Checker, Reviewer).</p>

    <h4>2. Input Validation and Sanitization:</h4>
    <p>Validations were performed both at the controller and service layer using annotations like <code>@Valid</code>,
        <code>@NotNull</code>, etc.</p>
    <p>We prevented injection attacks (like SQL injection or XSS) by using parameterized queries in Hibernate and
        avoiding direct user inputs in queries.</p>

    <h4>3. HTTPS and Secure Headers:</h4>
    <p>All APIs were deployed behind <strong>HTTPS</strong> to encrypt data in transit. We also added security headers
        (like <code>X-Content-Type-Options</code>, <code>X-Frame-Options</code>, etc.) in responses to mitigate common
        web vulnerabilities.</p>

    <h4>4. Rate Limiting and Throttling (planned/future-ready):</h4>
    <p>To avoid brute-force attacks and DoS, we had designs in place for implementing rate limiting using tools like API
        Gateway or filters.</p>

    <h4>5. Audit Logging and Monitoring:</h4>
    <p>User actions and API access were logged in audit tables. Logs were monitored for unauthorized access patterns or
        anomalies using log aggregators.</p>

    <h4>6. Exception Handling and Masking Sensitive Data:</h4>
    <p>Centralized exception handling using <code>@ControllerAdvice</code> was implemented to ensure stack traces or
        sensitive errors are not exposed to clients. We returned only generic messages in error responses while logging
        the actual error details internally.</p>

    <p>In short, API security is a layered approach — we ensured it through proper authentication, authorization, data
        validation, secure communication, and ongoing monitoring.</p>

                <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">What is your approach to logging, monitoring, or
                    debugging issues in production?</div>
<div class="answer">
    <h3>Logging and Monitoring Practices in the SmartReg Project</h3>

    <h4>1. Structured Logging:</h4>
    <p>We use <strong>SLF4J</strong> with <strong>Logback</strong> for consistent and readable logging.</p>
    <p>Logs are structured with unique request IDs, timestamps, log levels (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR), and context (like user
        ID or module name).</p>
    <p>For sensitive data, we ensure masking before logging.</p>

    <h4>2. Log Levels and Categories:</h4>
    <p>I configure appropriate log levels — keeping DEBUG for local/dev, and INFO/ERROR for production.</p>
    <p>In case of exceptions, we always log the root cause (<code>e.getMessage()</code> and stack trace), which helps
        during debugging.</p>

    <h4>3. Centralized Logging:</h4>
    <p>All logs are collected centrally using log aggregators (like <strong>ELK stack</strong> — Elasticsearch,
        Logstash, Kibana) or Fluentd with a dashboard.</p>
    <p>This allows the team to search logs across services, filter by user ID, and identify issues quickly.</p>

    <h4>4. Monitoring Tools:</h4>
    <p>We use <strong>Spring Boot Actuator</strong> for health checks and endpoint monitoring.</p>
    <p>Dockerized services have built-in health check scripts, which are also monitored by the deployment environment
        (like Jenkins/Kubernetes).</p>

    <h4>5. Alerting & Notifications:</h4>
    <p>For critical errors or service downtimes, we configure alerts via email or Slack using monitoring tools.</p>
    <p>This ensures we're immediately aware of any production issues.</p>

    <h4>6. Debugging in Production:</h4>
    <p>We never debug directly in production but use:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Detailed logs</li>
        <li>Audit trails</li>
        <li>Test case recreation in staging environments</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If needed, we simulate production data in lower environments to reproduce and fix issues safely.</p>

    <h4>Example:</h4>
    <p>Once in SmartReg, we had a report generation issue that wasn't reproducible in dev. By using the trace ID from
        logs, we correlated API calls and discovered that a null value from a dependent service caused a failure. The
        issue was resolved and we added a null check with a fallback value in the service layer.</p>
